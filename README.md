This task, which is a part of an entire project, includes an advanced search functionality built using Symfony, enabling users to query multiple entities such as Clients, Products, and Factures from a unified search bar. The implementation features a dedicated SearchService for database queries, a reusable SearchType form for capturing user input, and a dynamic results display in a clean and responsive Twig template. The solution is designed to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a seamless user experience.
